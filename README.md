Android App

   In order to solve the problems of gas station owners we have created an 
android app which will compare and display the prices of fuels from 
different suppliers and provide the cheapest price to gas station owners

   This will enable an independent gas station owners to look for cheapest fuel 
price on app with one-click button rather than searching for emails from 
different suppliers.
